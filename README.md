# StreamDeck Big Clock Plugin

A StreamDeck plugin that displays individual time components (hours, minutes, seconds, colons) on separate buttons, allowing you to create custom large digital clock layouts on your Stream Deck with perfect synchronization and smooth animations.

## Features

### Time Component Action
Display individual components of the current time that update in real-time with perfect synchronization across all buttons:

- **Individual Digits**: Show single digits from hours, minutes, or seconds
  - Hour (First Digit) - Shows the first digit of the hour (e.g., "1" from "12:34:56")
  - Hour (Second Digit) - Shows the second digit of the hour (e.g., "2" from "12:34:56")
  - Minute (First Digit) - Shows the first digit of the minute (e.g., "3" from "12:34:56")
  - Minute (Second Digit) - Shows the second digit of the minute (e.g., "4" from "12:34:56")
  - Second (First Digit) - Shows the first digit of the second (e.g., "5" from "12:34:56")
  - Second (Second Digit) - Shows the second digit of the second (e.g., "6" from "12:34:56")

- **Full Components**: Show complete time units
  - Hour (Full) - Shows the complete hour (e.g., "12" from "12:34:56")
  - Minute (Full) - Shows the complete minute (e.g., "34" from "12:34:56")
  - Second (Full) - Shows the complete second (e.g., "56" from "12:34:56")

- **Separators**: Show colon separators with smooth blinking animation
  - Colon (:) Hours/Minutes - Blinking separator between hours and minutes
  - Colon (:) Minutes/Seconds - Blinking separator between minutes and seconds

### Customization Options
- **Time Component**: Select which part of the time to display from dropdown
- **Time Format**: Choose between 12-hour and 24-hour format
- **Colon Blinking**: Enable/disable smooth colon blinking animation (500ms intervals)
- **Text Color**: Customize the color of digits and colons with color picker
- **Background Color**: Customize the button background color with color picker
- **Font Size**: Adjust text size with slider (20-144px range, default: 96px)
- **Font Family**: Choose from multiple font options (Arial, Helvetica, Georgia, etc.)

### Technical Features
- **Synchronized Timer System**: Single global timer ensures all buttons update simultaneously
- **Smooth Colon Animation**: Colons blink every 500ms for authentic digital clock feel
- **Performance Optimized**: Cached settings system with minimal API calls
- **Drag & Drop Resilient**: Timer continues running when moving buttons around
- **SVG Rendering**: Crisp, scalable graphics rendered directly on button canvas
- **Real-time Updates**: Display updates every second with perfect synchronization
- **Settings Persistence**: All customizations are saved and restored automatically

## Example Usage

To create a large digital clock display across 8 Stream Deck buttons, arrange them in a 8x1 grid and configure each button as follows:

```
[1] [2] [:] [3] [4] [:] [5] [6]
```

Where:
- Button 1: Hour (First Digit)
- Button 2: Hour (Second Digit)  
- Button 3: Colon
- Button 4: Minute (First Digit)
- Button 5: Minute (Second Digit)
- Button 6: Colon
- Button 7: Second (First Digit)
- Button 8: Second (Second Digit)

This would display something like: `1 2 : 3 4 : 5 6` for the time 12:34:56
